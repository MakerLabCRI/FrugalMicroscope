The focus was a challenge in the creation of our microscope in term of stability, utility and convenience. To address this challenge we had the idea of using a similar syringe hydraulic system, as the one that was previously used for X and Y axis. A 60 ml syringe upside down has been put in the middle of two boards, the second and the third superimposed on the first board at the bottom of the microscope thanks to four long screws. The low part of the piston is hung on the underneath of the third board and a hole in the second board is made to allow the syringe to pass. For a better stability, this one has been wound of grey tape to being perfectly fixed in the hole and the nozzle is linked to another syringe of 15 ml thanks to a plastic pipe to make the axes moving.
