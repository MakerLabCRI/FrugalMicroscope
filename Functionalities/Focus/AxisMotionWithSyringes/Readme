For the system of focusing constituting the Z axis, we used one main syringe that we put in the middle of the Brachioscope,
and 2 other syringues, which are the 2 syringes we manipulate : 
- One syringe to do the big focus : the syringe could contain a bigger volume
- One syringe to do the small focus : the syringe could contain less volume

We joined the 2 syringes of the big and small focus to the main syringe with a system of pipes and valve. Indeed, to do the small
focus, we had to close the valve so the water communicates only between the small focusing syringe and the main syringe, and not 
between the big focusing syringe and the main syringe, which is the case if we open the valve.

Our system was really efficient, except some problems we had that could be improved.
Indeed, our 2 syringes that we manipulate were not well fixed to the base platform, they moved and we had to hold them when 
we manipulate them ; it could be interesting to put really strong glue tu fix them to the platform, and a stem to fix the main
syringe.
