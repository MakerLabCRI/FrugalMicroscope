Our lightening ! 

To improve the light we decided to fix a screw on the plank under the small light that we used. 
Therefore, we just have to press it and the light is open ! 
Besides we dig a hole, the same size that the top of the light, on the plank just above the light. It allowed us to stabilize it.

So now we have an easy to open and stable light !
You can see those amazing improvement on the main photo of our Brachioscope !
