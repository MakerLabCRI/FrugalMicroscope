## 2 lights with switch system 
The lighting, is indispensable in the process of creating a microscope. For ours, we decided to put two lights : one below the lens and one above in order to have two different optical ways of observing the lamella. For the montage of the light of below, we added to the systeme a light switch. To do so, we used a solder to connect the light switch to a pile.
For the light placed on the above, we made the same thing but, this time, using a blue led that we fixed just below the phoneâ€™s camera.
