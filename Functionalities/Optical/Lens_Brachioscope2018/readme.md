For the lens, we wanted to be able to change the zoom (in the first version of the Turfuscope, there was just one lens). In purpose of being able to do this, we create a mobile platform with 3 holes. In each hole, we put a classical microscope lens.

THIS IS A LITTLE DEMONSTRATION VIDEO :

what an ingenious system, isn't it ?

The mobile platform was realised by putting a disk of plexiglas (cut with our laserprinter) on a whole placed on the XY axis platform. For the lens, we just picked them from a microscope which was here. You can buy them easily they do not cost so much.
Thanks to this system, the lens are interchangables ! we can now be much more precise than before.

(that is the principle)

But with this system, we had some problems : When a sample is positionned and focused to a zoom and we want to switch to a higher zoom, the lense is most of the time longer... so we have to get down the sample and this will potentially moving it from the place we targeted. This also means that the focus has to be done again...

Maybe this could be fixed by choosing another type of lens.
