For the lens, we wanted to be able to change the zoom. In purpose of being able to do this, we create a mobile platform with 3 holes. In each hole, we put a classical microscope lens.

The mobile platform was realised by putting a circle of plexiglas (cut with our laserprinter) on a whole placed on the XY axis platform.
