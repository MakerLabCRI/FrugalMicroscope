For the lens, we wanted to be able to change the zoom. In purpose of being able to do this, we create a mobile platform with 3 holes. In each hole, we put a classical microscope lens.

THIS IS A LITTLE DEMONSTRATION VIDEO :


The mobile platform was realised by putting a disk of plexiglas (cut with our laserprinter) on a whole placed on the XY axis platform. For the lens, we just picked them from a microscope which was here. You can buy them easily they do not cost so much.
