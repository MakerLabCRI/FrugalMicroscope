We designed a hydraulic system with syringes containing water to move the lamella along X and Y axis. This system is composed of 2 boards, one to moving along X and the other one along Y. This up and down system for the focus. To move the boards we used 15 mL or 10ml syringes with water. The system is relatively simple. Indeed, you  just have to connect 2 syringes of 15 mL or 10ml   containing water together and then, let the hydraulic pressure do the rest. Actually, pressing or pulling the piston of the syringes, induces a lever effect that causes the board to move!
