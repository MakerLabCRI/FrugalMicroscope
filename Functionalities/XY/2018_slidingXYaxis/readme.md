Our ingenious yet very simple mechanism!

The goal of this improvement (along the one of the Z axis) was to move only the plate on which the lenses are as a XY axis. This should technically grant us more stability and thus more precise observation.
We made sure none of the metallic branches stuck through the wooden plate of the XY axis for the microscope to be compatible with any model of mobile phone. The device has to be layed down on the of the microscope, the lense of its camera aligned with the opening of the lense.
We made the lenses not only interchangeable but multiple, as we see on the GIF. The advantage is to be able to focus on a precise part of the sample and being able to zoom in up to 3 times.

LIMITS:
One obvious limit to our system is the straightness of the metallic branches. They have to be really at a 90Â° angle with the plate they are fixed to and be absoluetly straight. Without these conditions fullfilled, the XY may not be able to move to its full potential, it may not even move at all.
We fixed that problem with cables surrounding the branches to pull them together. With the correct force, it works, but it's ugly...

The second limit is a bit more complicated to solve. It comes from the different length of the lenses. When a sample is positionned and focused to a low zoom and we want to switch to a higher zoom, the lense is most of the time longer and collides with the sample, potentially moving it from the place we targeted. This also means that the focus has to be done again.

A good improvement would be to create a way to fix the phone one the wooden plate which would still be compatible with any model of mobile phone.
