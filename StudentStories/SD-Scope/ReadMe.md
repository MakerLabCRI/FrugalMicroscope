Jacquesâ€™ Turfuscope worked pretty good (he invented the syringe system, which had never been seen on the internet before), but it had some issues.The user had no control of the movement along the XY axes, and even though his syringe system worked, it had an horizontality problem.

--> So what did we do?

Designing a movable plate (XY movement)

Improving the Z movement

The artificial compressor

Wheeled length modulator
