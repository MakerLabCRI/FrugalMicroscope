  ### 3D Printing
   ##### by @missnjf and 

We decided to focus on adding the possibility to 3D print the samples we could see on the original microscope. 
Our initial idea was to find a **3D scanner** app on smartphone (which would therefore be frugal).
At first we used the **[QLONE]**(https://www.qlone.pro/) app on iPhone, which only costs 1â‚¬ :

But it obliged us to have a sheet of paper underneath the object to scan, and samples are way too small compared to the size of the paper.
So we went on with **[TRNIO]**(http://www.trnio.com/) app (which is free)
```
git status
git command
git mes steaks
