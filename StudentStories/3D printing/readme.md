**Our elaboration and reflexion**

We decided to focus on adding the possibility to 3D print the samples we could see on the original microscope. 
Our initial idea was to find a **3D scanner** app on smartphone (which would therefore be frugal).
At first we used the [QLONE](https://www.qlone.pro/) app on iPhone, which is free :

But it obliged us to have a sheet of paper underneath the object to scan, and samples are way too small compared to the size of the paper.
So we went on with [TRNIO](http://www.trnio.com/) app (which only costs 1â‚¬) and built this device :

The issue was then that the objects were so small that the app couldn't scan them very well.


So we had to give up the idea of 3D scanning.
We decided to take pictures of a 2D sample of a pine stem cell, and convert it using a computer into a file that we could send to the 3D printer.

At first we used [BLENDER](https://www.blender.org/) and obtained through extrudation this image :

But unfortunately it wasn't a 3D object that we could scan... =(
So we went on Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop in order to convert the cell's perimeter into a vectorial drawing. That way, the laser cutter would cut the cell and to grave the surface. It worked !!! We had this cell :
