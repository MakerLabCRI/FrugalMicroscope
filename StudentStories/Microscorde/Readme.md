  We have noticed that the focus was not precise on the previous version of the turfuscope so we decided to improve it. We split the macro and micro foci to improve precision and removed all the air that was left in the syringe to remove the delay between the moment your manipulate the syringe and the one where the sample actually moves.
  We also improved the light by adding a modular LED that is controlled through a potentiometer.
