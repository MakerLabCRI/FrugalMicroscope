##**Narration**

In 2017, Jacques had an idea of building a”‘hydraulic microscope”, using syringes filled with water to move the x axis. He called it the Turfuscope.
Our group decided to work on that idea and improve his syringe system. We imagined a microscope completely syringes-functioning for sizing (xy) and focus (z). The main goal was to take the highest quality pictures with a smartphone. So we had to design a support for the phone that was set just above the microscope’s lens. 
Our microscope has the advantage to be very stable due to its relatively big size, so that taken pictures aren’t blurry.
We also thought about adding a features that allows people to switch the lens. Here we encountered some problems, dep
In the end we managed to make the Turfuscope 2.0, an enhanced version of the hydraulic microscope.

Here we encountered some issues about the capacity of the cell phone to adapt it’s picture’s quality to all types of lens. With big lenses that we took from « classic » microscope, the distance between the phone camera and the lens was about few centimeters and the lens was not in direct contact with the thing to visualize. However, when we tried our system to switch lens and be able to use a different zoom for exemple, we figured that the distance between the micro-organism and the lens (and also between the phone and the lens) was too big and made the image on the phone blurred ; even if the distance was the same as with the « classical » lens, we didn’t anticipated that his distance would be so important.

To reduce the minimal distance between lens and lamella, we just made the move on Z-axis, more efficient, in order to push the board with the lamella very close to the lens.

For reduce the distance lens/phone camera, we thought about a system of lens that you could fix on your cell-phone, it would really diminish the blury sensation you have with a cellphone too much


Here, we describe the microscope viewed from the above 
Laser cutter 6 boards (the n°1,2 and 5 have the same size) using our plans (file on illustrator).
Drilling the boards
Assembling each board (n°1 to n°6 starting from the bottom) : 
Board n°1 : Stick 3 small syringes on the top of the board. One has to be placed vertically and the other 2 have to be placed horizontally.

Board n°2: In the biggest hole, insert the biggest syringe, that will allow the mobility on the Z axis. In the other circular hole, insert the lamp. In the rectangle-shaped hole, insert the interruptor that’s linked to the lamp 

Board n°3: no holes on the sides but only one on the left part of the board to allow light to come, this action is done by the laser cutter 

Board n°4: to strengthen the stability of the boards that move on x and y axis, we put 2 cork structures

Board n°5: Hole on the side to allow light to come. Support to put the microscope slide, this board can move in x,y and z to do a better adaptation for the observation of the microscope slide. There is some wedge on the board which surrounds the microscope slide to prevent it from moving (of course a space is clear to be able to change the slide)

Board n°6 : Support for the lens and the phone. There is a hole which give directly on the slide and the light below. This is the top board.
