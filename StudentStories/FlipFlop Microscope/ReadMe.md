    Objectifs

Our objective with Flip Flop was to construct a cheap, pocket size and easily to build microscope that can be reversible. 

This microscope claims to open the exploration of the small objects, because of its size you can bring it everywhere and it can be adapted to various situations. 

The reversible model can help you to study not only slides but also cell culture in petri boxes. This microscope model will become a This prototype needs a bigger version in order to function with this kind of instrument, however the materials used allow the model to be an easy option to create a portable one even if it would be bigger.*

    Optical
    
We have used an unexpensive and very effective lense, the balls inside pen ink cartridge. This lense came from the foldscope microscope and so there was a module that contained it. To make it usefull we have drilled a little hole according to the diameter of the lense, and so it was slotting well.

    Axe X Y
    
For the X axe, thanks to the opening on the side we can manually manipulate the microscope slide very easily.
For the Y axe, the space is just enough to slip the observation slide, so you only 
can see what is align with the lens.

    Focus
    
Due of our type of lense we didn't need to do a focusing stuff.
Else, just use the elastic bands to raise or lower the observation slide.


    Light
    
Our microscope uses an light we a switch power button on the bottom. This light is glue to the body of the microspe and it can be used rom the bottom or on the upside of the microscope.

    How to build it?
