The goal of this project was to improve diverse functionnalities of the Turfuscope. We tried to solve the problem of the sample platform stability as well as the XY axis, the focus and came up with a system of interchangeable lenses. 

To realize the blueprints of our beautiful microscope, we used Adobe Illustrator. It was then printed with the laser cutter (Epilog Laser MINI). 

The improvements that we did were:
  - x,y axis independence from z axis, so we don't disturb the z axis stability
